Map. 

 Use the map() function to take any number and scale it to a new number that is more useful for the project that you are working on. For example, use the numbers from the mouse position to control the size or color of a shape. In this example, the mouseâ€™s x-coordinate (numbers between 0 and 360) are scaled to new numbers to define the color and size of a circle.
