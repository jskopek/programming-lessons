Conditionals 1. 

 Conditions are like questions. They allow a program to decide to take one action if the answer to a question is "true" or to do another action if the answer to the question is "false." The questions asked within a program are always logical or relational statements. For example, if the variable 'i' is equal to zero then draw a line.
