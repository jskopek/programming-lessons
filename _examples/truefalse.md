True/False. 

 A Boolean variable has only two possible values: true or false. It is common to use Booleans with control statements to determine the flow of a program. In this example, when the boolean value "x" is true, vertical black lines are drawn and when the boolean value "x" is false, horizontal gray lines are drawn.
