Operator Precedence 

 If you don't explicitly state the order in which an expression is evaluated, they are evaluated based on the operator precedence. For example, in the statement "4+2*8", the 2 will first be multiplied by 8 and then the result will be added to 4. This is because the "*" has a higher precedence than the "+". To avoid ambiguity in reading the program, it is recommended that is statement is written as "4+(2*8)". The order of evaluation can be controlled through placement of parenthesis in the code. A table of operator precedence follows below.
