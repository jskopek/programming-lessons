Acceleration with Vectors by Daniel Shiffman. 

 Demonstration of the basics of motion with vector. A "Mover" object stores location, velocity, and acceleration as vectors The motion is controlled by affecting the acceleration (in this case towards the mouse) * For more examples of simulating motion and physics with vectors, see Simulate/ForcesWithVectors, Simulate/GravitationalAttraction3D
