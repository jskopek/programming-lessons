# Description

This keyword is used to disallow other classes access to the fields and methods within a class. The private keyword is used before a field or method that you want to be available only within the class. In Processing, all fields and methods are public unless otherwise specified by the private keyword.

This keyword is an essential part of Java programming and is not usually used with Processing. Consult a Java language reference or tutorial for more information.
