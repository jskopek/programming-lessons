# Description

Utility function for formatting numbers into strings. Similar to nf() but puts a "+" in front of positive numbers and a "-" in front of negative numbers. There are two versions: one for formatting floats, and one for formatting ints. The values for the digits, left, and right parameters should always be positive integers.
