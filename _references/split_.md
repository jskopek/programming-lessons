# Description

The split() function breaks a String into pieces using a character or string as the delimiter. The delim parameter specifies the character or characters that mark the boundaries between each piece. A String[] array is returned that contains each of the pieces.
 
If the result is a set of numbers, you can convert the String[] array to a float[] or int[] array using the datatype conversion functions int() and float().  (See the second example above.)
  
The splitTokens() function works in a similar fashion, except that it splits using a range of characters instead of a specific character or sequence.
