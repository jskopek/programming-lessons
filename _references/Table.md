# Description

Table objects store data with multiple rows and columns, much like in a traditional spreadsheet.  Tables can be generated from scratch, dynamically, or using data from an existing file.  Tables can also be output and saved to disk, as in the example above.

Additional Table methods are documented in the Processing Table Javadoc.
