# Description

Works like an if else structure, but switch is more convenient when you need to select between three or more alternatives. Program controls jumps to the case with the same value as the expression. All remaining statements in the switch are executed unless redirected by a break. Only primitive datatypes which can convert to an integer (byte, char, and int) may be used as the expression parameter. The default is optional.
