# Description

A JSONObject stores JSON data with multiple name/value pairs.  Values can be numeric, Strings, booleans, other JSONObjects or JSONArrays, or null.  JSONObject and JSONArray objects are quite similar and share most of the same methods; the primary difference is that the latter stores an array of JSON objects, while the former represents a single JSON object.

JSON can be generated from scratch, dynamically, or using data from an existing file.  JSON can also be output and saved to disk, as in the example above.
