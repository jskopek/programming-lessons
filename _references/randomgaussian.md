# Description

Returns a float from a random series of numbers having a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Each time the randomGaussian() function is called, it returns a number fitting a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. There is theoretically no minimum or maximum value that randomGaussian() might return. Rather, there is just a very low probability that values far from the mean will be returned; and a higher probability that numbers near the mean will be returned.
