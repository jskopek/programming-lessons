# Description

Sets the ambient reflectance for shapes drawn to the screen. This is combined with the ambient light component of environment. The color components set through the parameters define the reflectance. For example in the default color mode, setting v1=255, v2=127, v3=0, would cause all the red light to reflect and half of the green light to reflect. Used in combination with emissive(), specular(), and shininess() in setting the material properties of shapes.
