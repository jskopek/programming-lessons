# Description

Sets the spacing between lines of text in units of pixels. This setting will be used in all subsequent calls to the text() function.  Note, however, that the leading is reset by textSize(). For example, if the leading is set to 20 with textLeading(20), then if textSize(48) is run at a later point, the leading will be reset to the default for the text size of 48.
