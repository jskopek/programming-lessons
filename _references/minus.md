# Description

Subtracts one value from another and may also be used to negate a value. As a subtraction operator, the value of the second parameter is subtracted from the first. For example, 5 - 3 yields the number 2. As a negation operator, it is equivalent to multiplying a number by -1. For example, -5 is the same as 5 * -1.
