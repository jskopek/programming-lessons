# Description

Converts an int or String to its boolean representation.  For an int, any non-zero value (positive or negative) evaluates to true, while zero evaluates to false. For a String, the value "true" evaluates to true, while any other value (including "false" or "hippopotamus") evaluates to false.

When an array of int or String values is passed in, then a boolean array of the same length is returned.
