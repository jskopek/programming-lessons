# Description

Datatype for characters, typographic symbols such as A, d, and $. A char stores letters and symbols in the Unicode format, a coding system developed to support a variety of world languages. Each char is two bytes (16 bits) in length and is distinguished by surrounding it with single quotes. Character escapes may also stored as a char. For example, the representation for the "delete" key is 127. The first time a variable is written, it must be declared with a statement expressing its datatype. Subsequent uses of this variable must not reference the datatype because Processing will think the variable is being declared again.
