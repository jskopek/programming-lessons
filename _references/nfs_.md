# Description

Utility function for formatting numbers into strings. Similar to nf(), but leaves a blank space in front of positive numbers so they align with negative numbers in spite of the minus symbol. There are two versions: one for formatting floats, and one for formatting ints. The values for the digits, left, and right parameters should always be positive integers.
