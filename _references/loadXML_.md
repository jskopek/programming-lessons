# Description

Reads the contents of a file or URL and creates an XML object with its values. If a file is specified, it must be located in the sketch's "data" folder. The filename parameter can also be a URL to a file found online.

All files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. If you need to load an XML file that's not in UTF-8 format, see the developer's reference for the XML object.
