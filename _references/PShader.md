# Description

This class encapsulates a GLSL shader program, including a vertex and a fragment shader. It's compatible with the P2D and P3D renderers, but not with the default renderer. Use the loadShader() function to load your shader code. [Note: It's strongly encouraged to use loadShader() to create a PShader object, rather than calling the PShader constructor manually.]
