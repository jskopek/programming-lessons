# Description

Evaluates the curve at point t for points a, b, c, d. The parameter t may range from 0 (the start of the curve) and 1 (the end of the curve). a and d are points on the curve, and b and c are the control points. This can be used once with the x coordinates and a second time with the y coordinates to get the location of a curve at t.
