# Description

The getVertex() method returns a PVector with the coordinates of the vertex point located at the position defined by the index parameter. This method works when shapes are created as shown in the example above, but won't work properly when a shape is defined explicitly (e.g. createShape(RECT, 20, 20, 80, 80).
