# Description

Subtracts x, y, and z components from a vector, subtracts one vector from another, or subtracts two independent vectors. The version of the method that substracts two vectors is a static method and returns a PVector, the others act directly on the vector. See the examples for more context.  In all cases, the second vector (v2) is subtracted from the first (v1), resulting in v1-v2.
