# Description

Multiplies a vector by a scalar.  The version of the method that uses a float acts directly on the vector upon which it is called (as in the first example above).  The versions that receive both a PVector and a float as arguments are static methods, and each returns a new PVector that is the result of the multiplication operation.  Both examples above produce the same visual output.
