# Description

Keyword used to indicate the value to return from a function. The value being returned must be the same datatype as defined in the function declaration. Functions declared with void can't return values and shouldn't include a return value.

The keyword return may also be used to break out of a function, thus not allowing the program to  the remaining statements. (See the third example above.)
