# Description

Divides a vector by a scalar.  The version of the method that uses a float acts directly on the vector upon which it is called (as in the first example above).  The version that receives both a PVector and a float as arguments is a static methods, and returns a new PVector that is the result of the division operation.  Both examples above produce the same visual output.
