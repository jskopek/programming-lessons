# Description

Datatype for floating-point numbers larger than those that can be stored in a float. A float is a 32-bit values that can be as large as 3.40282347E+38 and as low as -3.40282347E+38. A double can be used similarly to a float, but can have a greater magnitude because it's a 64-bit number. Processing functions don't use this datatype, so while they work in the language, you'll usually have to convert to a float using the (float) syntax before passing into a function.
