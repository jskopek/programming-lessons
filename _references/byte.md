# Description

Datatype for bytes, 8 bits of information storing numerical values from 127 to -128. Bytes are a convenient datatype for sending information to and from the serial port and for representing letters in a simpler format than the char datatype. The first time a variable is written, it must be declared with a statement expressing its datatype. Subsequent uses of this variable must not reference the datatype because Processing will think the variable is being declared again.
