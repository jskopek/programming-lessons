# Description

Writes the contents of an XML object to a file. By default, this file is saved to the sketch's folder. This folder is opened by selecting "Show Sketch Folder" from the "Sketch" menu.

Alternatively, the file can be saved to any location on the computer by using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows).

All files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding.
