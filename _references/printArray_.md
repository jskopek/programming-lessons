# Description

The printArray() function writes array data to the text area of the Processing environment's console. A new line is put between each element of the array. This function can only print one dimensional arrays.

Note that the console is relatively slow. It works well for occasional messages, but does not support high-speed, real-time output (such as at 60 frames per second).
