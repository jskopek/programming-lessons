# Description

A HashMap stores a collection of objects, each referenced by a key. This is similar to an Array, only instead of accessing elements with a numeric index, a String is used. (If you are familiar with associative arrays from other languages, this is the same idea.) The above example covers basic use, but there's a more extensive example included with the Processing examples.  In addition, for simple pairings of Strings and integers, Strings and floats, or Strings and Strings, you can now use the simpler IntDict, FloatDict, and StringDict classes.

For a list of the numerous HashMap features, please read the Java reference description.
