# Description

Sets the specular color of the materials used for shapes drawn to the screen, which sets the color of highlights. Specular refers to light which bounces off a surface in a preferred direction (rather than bouncing in all directions like a diffuse light). Used in combination with emissive(), ambient(), and shininess() in setting the material properties of shapes.
