# Description

The mouseWheel() function returns positive values when the mouse wheel is rotated down (toward the user), and negative values for the other direction (up or away from the user). On OS X with "natural" scrolling enabled, the values are opposite.

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has draw(). Without draw(), the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
