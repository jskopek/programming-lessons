# Description

The pushStyle() function saves the current style settings and popStyle() restores the prior settings; these functions are always used together. They allow you to change the style settings and later return to what you had. When a new style is started with pushStyle(), it builds on the current style information. The pushStyle() and popStyle() functions can be embedded to provide more control (see the second example above for a demonstration.)
