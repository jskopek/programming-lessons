# Description

The settings() function is new with Processing 3.0. It's not needed in most sketches. It's only useful when it's absolutely necessary to define the parameters to size() with a variable. Alternately, the settings() function is necessary when using Processing code outside of the Processing Development Environment (PDE). For example, when using the Eclipse code editor, it's necessary to use settings() to define the size() and smooth() values for a sketch.
