# Description

Converts a degree measurement to its corresponding value in radians. Radians and degrees are two ways of measuring the same thing. There are 360 degrees in a circle and 2*PI radians in a circle. For example, 90Â° = PI/2 = 1.5707964. All trigonometric functions in Processing require their parameters to be specified in radians.
