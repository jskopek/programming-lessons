# Description

Sets the shape to be visible or invisible. This is determined by the value of the visible parameter.

The default visibility of a shape is usually controlled by whatever program created the SVG file. For instance, this parameter is controlled by showing or hiding the shape in the layers palette in Adobe Illustrator.
