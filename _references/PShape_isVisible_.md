# Description

Returns a boolean value "true" if the image is set to be visible, "false" if not. This value can be modified with the setVisible() method.

The default visibility of a shape is usually controlled by whatever program created the SVG file. For instance, this parameter is controlled by showing or hiding the shape in the layers palette in Adobe Illustrator.
