# Description

Datatype for integers, numbers without a decimal point. Integers can be as large as 2,147,483,647 and as low as -2,147,483,648. They are stored as 32 bits of information. The first time a variable is written, it must be declared with a statement expressing its datatype. Subsequent uses of this variable must not reference the datatype because Processing will think the variable is being declared again.
