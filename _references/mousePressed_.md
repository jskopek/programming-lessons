# Description

The mousePressed() function is called once after every time a mouse button is pressed. The mouseButton variable (see the related reference entry) can be used to determine which button has been pressed.

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has draw(). Without draw(), the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
