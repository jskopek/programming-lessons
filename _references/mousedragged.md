# Description

The mouseDragged() function is called once every time the mouse moves while a mouse button is pressed. (If a button is not being pressed, mouseMoved() is called instead.)

Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has draw(). Without draw(), the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
