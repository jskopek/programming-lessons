# Description

Keyword used to indicate the declaration of a class. A class is a composite of fields (data) and methods (functions that are a part of the class) which may be instantiated as objects. The first letter of a class name is usually uppercase to separate it from other kinds of variables. A related tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming is hosted on the Oracle website.
