# Description

When a mouse button is pressed, the value of the system variable mouseButton is set to either LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER, depending on which button is pressed. (If no button is pressed, mouseButton may be reset to 0. For that reason, it's best to use mousePressed first to test if any button is being pressed, and only then test the value of mouseButton, as shown in the examples above.)
