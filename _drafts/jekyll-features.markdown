Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight processing %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight diff %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
+ testing
- test
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

One small step for
```diff
-man
+humankind
testing
```
