Let's write our first program! Type the line below into the Processing text editor:

{% highlight processing %}
circle(10,10,10);
{% endhighlight %}

You should see this on your screen:

{% include tip.html content="If you are typing and nothing shows up, make sure it is <em>focused</em> by clicking your cursor anywhere on the white part (this is the text editor) to select it. You should now be able to type into it." %}

Let's run your program! Click on the "Play" icon on the top of the "Processing" window:
