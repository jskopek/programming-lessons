We will be using a program called "Processing" to write our programs. Before we can write anything, we need to open this program.

Look for the "Processing" icon on the desktop. It should look like this:

Double click on the icon to open Processing. Once it has loaded, you should see the "Processing" text editor on your screen:

Congratulations! We are now ready to start making our first Processing program!
