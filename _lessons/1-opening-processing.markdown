We will be using a program called "Processing" to write our programs. Before we can write anything, we need to open this program.

Look for the "Processing" icon on the desktop. It should look like this:

![Processing icon](/assets/images/lesson1-1.png)

Double click on the icon to open Processing. Once it has loaded, you should see the "Processing" text editor on your screen:

![Processing app](/assets/images/lesson1-2.png)

We use the Processing program to write our own programs. To write a program, we click on the white area and type our program. Once we have finished writing our program, we click on the <i class="fa fa-play"></i> Play button to run it.

{% include tip.html content="If you are typing and nothing shows up, make sure it is <em>focused</em> by clicking your cursor anywhere on the white part (this is the text editor) to select it. You should now be able to type into it." %}

Congratulations! We are now ready to start making our first Processing program!
