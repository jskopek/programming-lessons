We will be using a program called **Processing** to create our programs. Before we can make anything, we need to open Processing.

{% include tip.html content="Wait, we're using a program to write our program? Believe it or not, every program is made using another program. Makes you wonder how the very first programs were made!" %}

Look for the "Processing" icon on the desktop. It should look like this:

Double click on the icon to open Processing. Once it has loaded, you should see the **Processing** text editor on your screen:

We use **Processing** to write our own programs. To write a program, we click on the white area and type our instructions. Once we have finished writing our program, we click on the <i class="fa fa-play"></i> Play button to run it:

We are now ready to start making our first program!
